//	collections utility class in the java collection framework that provide static methods to operate on collections it contains methods such as

//	java Collections Framework:

//	1	Introduction:
//
//		The Java Collections Framework is a standardized framework in the java.util package.
//		It provides a set of interfaces and classes for handling and manipulating collections of objects.
//		Key Interfaces:
//
//	2	Collection: Root interface for collections, providing common methods like add, remove, and contains.
//		List: Ordered collection allowing duplicate elements, accessed by index (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
//		Set: Unordered collection, doesn't allow duplicates (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet).
//		Map: Represents key-value pairs (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap).
//		Common Implementation Classes:
//
//	3	ArrayList: Dynamic array implementation of the List interface.
//		LinkedList: Doubly linked list implementation of the List interface.
//		HashSet: Implements Set using a hash table for storage.
//		HashMap: Implements Map using a hash table for key-value pairs.
//		Utilities:
//
//	4	The Collections class provides static utility methods for common operations on collections.
//		Examples include sort, shuffle, reverse, and binarySearch.
//		Advantages:
//
//	5	Standardized and reusable framework.
//		Promotes consistency in handling collections.
//		Offers flexibility in choosing the appropriate data structure for specific use cases.
//		Enhances code readability and maintainability.
//		Role in Java Programming:
//
//	6	A fundamental part of Java development.
//		Widely used for tasks involving data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
//		Facilitates efficient and structured handling of collections.
//		In summary, the Java Collections Framework is a robust and essential component of Java programming, 
//		providing a standardized way to work with collections of objects and offering flexibility and efficiency in data manipulation.
