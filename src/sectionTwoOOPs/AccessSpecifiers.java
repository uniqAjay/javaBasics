public class AccessSpecifiers {
	

//In Java, access specifiers (also known as access modifiers) are keywords used to control the visibility and accessibility of classes,
//methods, and fields in a program. There are four main access specifiers in Java:
	
//	1 Public (public):
//
//		Public members are accessible from any other class.
//		There is no restriction on access.
	
//	2 Private (private):
//
//		Private members are only accessible within the same class.
//		They are not visible to other classes.
	
//	3 Protected (protected):
//
//		Protected members are accessible within the same class, same package, and by subclasses (even if they are in a different package).
//		They are not accessible by unrelated classes in different packages.

//	4 Default (Package-Private):
//
//		If no access specifier is used, it is considered package-private (default).
//		Members are accessible only within the same package.
