public class Abstraction {
	
//	Abstraction in Java:
//
//		Definition: Abstraction is a key concept in Java that involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on essential features and ignoring unnecessary details.
//
//		Mechanism:
//
//		Abstract Class: A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods.
//		Interface: A collection of abstract methods; classes implementing an interface must provide concrete implementations.
