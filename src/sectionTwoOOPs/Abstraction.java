public class Abstraction {
	
//	Abstraction in Java:
//
//		Definition: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object.
//	 				In Java, abstraction is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces.
//		Mechanism:
//
//		Abstract Class: A class that cannot be instantiated and may contain both abstract (unimplemented) and concrete (implemented) methods.
//		Interface: A collection of abstract methods; classes implementing an interface must provide concrete implementations.
